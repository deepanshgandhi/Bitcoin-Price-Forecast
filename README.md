# Short-Term Bitcoin Price Forecast Using Vector Representation Of Time
## Abhishek Singh Kushwah, Deepansh Gandhi

Abstract - Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the use of intermediaries. The main problem with these types of cryptocurrencies is price volatility. This paper demonstrates a high-performance model with Univariate Time Series Data and applying Regression using an invariant vector representation of Data. The model evaluation with mean absolute error for two different time ranges in data are MAE: 63.58(15-21) and MAE: 38.32(19-21).
